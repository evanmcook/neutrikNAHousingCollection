### bottle opener
the NA housing can be used to create a lever, for the opening of bottles. 
this is not an affordable project. there are much better ways to open bottles. some may argue this project a bad idea, and they have good reason to say so.  
this project requires an order from SendCutSend, and is therefore less 'off the shelf' than other projects in this collection.
