### flash drive storage
the NA housing can be used to enclose USB storage, in order to 'ruggedize' it.  
the flash drive must be compact, in order to fit inside the confines of the NA housing.   
this is not an affordable project. some may argue it is a bad idea, and they have good reason to say so.
